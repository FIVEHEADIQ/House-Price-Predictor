# House Price Prediction
This is a Python module that uses machine learning to predict house prices based on address and details. The module utilizes a gradient boosting regression algorithm to train a model on a dataset of house prices. It takes into account the address and specific details of each house to make accurate price predictions. The model is trained on historical housing data from various sources to learn patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (price).

## Installation

To use this module, you'll need Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:



Please note that the model has an error% of around 36%, also note that the prices used for the training data are prices taken from March of 2021, with the current real estate market trends for the GTA, you can assume the price has gone down by around 11%. NOTE: The data for this model is only for GTA homes, entering any value for addresses or details not in the database will result in an error shown. The data set can be seen in the main.py file. 

You can download the necessary packages using the following command line: pip install -r requirements.txt
